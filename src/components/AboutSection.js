            A detail-oriented developer and student with
            strong interest in building code that doesn't just "work", but can
            grow to do even more than originally expected.
            <br/><br/>
                My interests began with a fascination for invention which eventually
                drove me to focus my time developing websites, apps and games. I've developed most my skills in C#, Java, JavaScript, HTLM and CSS.
                
              <br/><br/>
              When given any project, my creative process always starts with a user-first approachâ€”every design decision I make is aimed towards the end user to deliver intuitive, visually compelling, and effective technical solutions.
