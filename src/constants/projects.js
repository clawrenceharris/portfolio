      "Pac-Rat is a Unity puzzle in which players navigate a maze, strategically rotating and moving board sections to create solvable paths to the exit.",
      "In addition to leading the game design and development process, I also collaborated with the visual design team to ensure cohesive alignment with the project vision. I thoughtfully programmed the core mechanics and user interface, consistently prioritizing scalable design patterns over quick, temporary solutions.",
      "The biggest challenge was level design. The bulk of the design required balancing the constraints and freedoms of each mechanic, and translating them to levels that challenge the player and force them to think harder about their moves.",
      "As the game soon comes to completion, I feel confident in building unique and complex level mechanics that, together, offer a satisfying balance between reward and challenge.",

    description: "Unity Puzzle Game",
    longDescription: [
      "Two Dots has remained one of my cherished mobile puzzle games. The premise of the game involves connecting dots of the same color to form squares, which subsequently clears all dots of the same color from the board. My journey with this endeavor began around 2020, but I initially found it too challenging and took a hiatus. However, several years later, equipped with enhanced Unity game development skills and renewed confidence, I embarked on the project from near scratch. This time proved to be a success, as I was able to develop a satisfying product.",
      "In the initial stages of the project, I encountered a challenge with organizing the code effectively, particularly in separating visual components from game logic. To address this, I implemented a customized version of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, tailored specifically for Unity, which proved instrumental in resolving the issue.",
      "In addition to the Anchor Dots and Blank Dots that are common mechanics in the original game, I also created one more called Clock Dots, offering a new and unique gameplay. Overall, this project demonstrates my game programming and level design skills which continue to strengthen as I continue to work on new additions to the game. ",
